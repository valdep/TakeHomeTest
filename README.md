In this repo you will find my implementation of the Take Home Test.

# My best project

One of the project I am the most proud is the software I developped for a product prototype at Hager.
The product was a wireless connected Siren for a new product range. It was a real challenge because I had very few ressources in terms of memory (only few kBytes of RAM and ROM) and power consumption (all products at Hager are on battery). Moreover I had to respect a radio communication protocol used by the other products in order to communicate with them.

The target of my software was an ARM microcontroler that I programmed in C langage.
Moreover I used a real-time OS (QP Framework in this case) in my application in order to schedule the different tasks, for exemple drive the radio chip or react to external interrupt.

Finally, I conceived the architecture of my application with UML (the architecture mainly consist of several finite state machines), I also documented the code with dOxygen and used Git for the version management.
